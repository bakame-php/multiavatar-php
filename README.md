### Installation ###

If you don't use composer, just include the autoloader in the root of the directory in your application.

```
require_once '/path/to/directory/Multiavatar/autoload.php';
```

Via Composer:

```bash
composer require multiavatar/multiavatar-php
```

### Usage ###

```php
<?php

use Multiavatar\Multiavatar;

$multiavatar = new Multiavatar();
$avatarId = "Binx Bond";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId);
```

For advanced usage, you can pass an array as a second and last parameter as shown below:

```php
<?php

use Multiavatar\Multiavatar;

$multiavatar = new Multiavatar();
$avatarId = "ANY_STRING_OR_INT";
$options = [
    'ver' => [
        'part' => '11', 
        'theme' => 'C',
    ], 
    'sansEnv' => true,
];

echo $multiavatar($avatarId, $options);
```
The option array contains the following indexes:

- `sansEnv`: Tells whether the environment should be display or not. By default, the environment is display.  
  To remove the environment you should set the value to `true.
  
- `version`: Indicate which theme and shape should be used to generate the avatar.  
  There is 3 themes that you specify with the `theme` index named from `A` to `C`
  and 16 shapes specified with the `part` index whose named ranged from `00` to `15`.
  
Each of those values can be set independently of each other.

```php
<?php

use Multiavatar\Multiavatar;

$multiavatar = new Multiavatar();

// Default usage
// The shape will be selected from the $avatarId
// The theme will be selected from the avatarId
// The environment is shown
$avatarId = "Starcrasher";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId);

// The shape will be selected from the $avatarId
// The theme will be selected from the avatarId
// Without the environment part
$avatarId = "Pandalion";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId, ['sansEnv' => true]);

// Generate a specific version
// version shape can be express in integer or in string containing only numbers. 
$avatarId = "Pandalion";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId, ['sansEnv' => false, 'ver' => ['part' => 11, 'theme' => 'C']]);

// The avatarId can be a string or an integer
// version theme are case insensitive. 
// The shape will be selected from the $avatarId
$avatarId = 123456789;
echo $multiavatar($avatarId, ['sansEnv' => false, 'ver' => ['theme' => 'b']]);

// Test with a specific shape
// The theme will be selected from the avatarId
$avatarId = "a86f755add37fe0b649c";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId, ['ver' => ['part' => '08']]);

$avatarId = "f7542474d54d2d2d97e4";
echo $multiavatar($avatarId);
```
